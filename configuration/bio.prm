#   Size   at   maturity.   This   is   an   optional   minimum   length   (where   the   allometric   length/weight   conversion   parameters   li_a_XXX   and   li_b_XXX   are   used   to   get   length)   required   for   sexual   maturation  in cm.   If   this   parameter   is   >   0   then   the   no   maturation   will   occur   in   an   age   class   if   it   is   below   the   maturation   length   even   if   FSPB   parameter   for   that   age   class   is   >   0.

#   flagstockingXX   indicates   whether   stocking   for   group   XX   is   on   (1)   or   not   (0).   This   occurs   in   addition   to   whatever   natural   recruitment   happens   as   a   result   of   flagrecruit   setting.   However   the   code   it   triggers   is   the   same   as   for   the   flagrecruit   option   18   so   to   see   what   files   you   have   to   set   up   (mainly   in   force.prm)   please   see   the   blog   post   on   multiple   recruitment   time   series   forcing.      If   you   set   flagstockingXX   to   1   then   you   need   all   the   additional   parameters   and   files   discussed   on   the   linked   blog   post.      You   do   not   need   to   set   flagrecruit   to   18   to   trigger   it,   flagrecruit   can   still   be   whatever   you   like.      If   you   do   set   flagrecruit   to   18   and   you   have   flagstocking   set   to   1   then   you   will   get   double   the   amount   of   recruits   added   (one   set   via   each   code   path).
